            “Generative AI has the potential to change the world in ways that we can’t even imagine. It has the power to
            create new ideas, products, and services that will make our lives easier, more productive, and more
            creative. It also has the potential to solve some of the world’s biggest problems, such as climate change,
            poverty, and disease.”</p>
