  <h2>CASE STUDIES</h2>
  <h4>AI Energy Consumption and Environmental Impact</h4>
  <p>Land and water impacts of data centers | Imagine you bought your home before a data center was built and added to
    the neighborhood. How would that ultimately change your daily living?</p>
  <br>
  <p>Data centers are known for their high energy consumption, pulling from non-renewable energy sources and adding to
    carbon emissions. The environmental impact extends beyond its energy use as data centers require significant water
    resources for cooling. This can result into a deficit on the local water supplies and adversely impact the
    surrounding ecosystems.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Part of the case study conducted by Rooted Intelligence is to examine these impacts and propose sustainable
    alternatives. We collaborated with ChatGPT, Copilot, and Google Gemini to depict what a possible future would look
    like if an AI hub was built into the neighborhood. How can we ensure developments are environmentally renewable and
    our housing market doesn't crash from such advancements?</p>

  Large AI hubs known as (data centers) can decrease the property value as they can consume large quantities of water
  due to cooling. Local droughts can evolve and deplete the community's water resources.
  <h5>Data Center Risk-Developments</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>AI and cloud facilities development into residential or rural areas are often incentivized by tax breaks.</li>
    <li><b>Resource-ravenous development</b>: This term is used by land policy experts to describe how these hubs drain
      energy and water resources.</li>

    <p>Infrastructure externalities: Negative side effects like land deterioration, noise, and reduced housing appeal.
    </p>
    <h5>Water Impacts</h5>

    <li></li>

    <li>High water usage: Data centers use millions of gallons annually to cool servers.</li>
    <li><b>Drought intensification:</b></li> This occurs when built in water-stressed regions worsen due to scarcity by
    competing with agriculture and households.
    <li><b>Aquifer depletion:</b></li> This occurs when continuous withdrawals can lower groundwater tables, resulting
    into a reduction in long-term pliability.
    <li><b>Thermal pollution:</b></li> This occurs when heated discharge water is returned to local waterways, harming
    aquatic ecosystems.

    <h5>Environmental & Community Consequences</h5>
    <li>Energy-water tradeoff: Cooling systems balance electricity use with water demand, but both strain local
      resources.</li>
    <h5>Housing & Land Value</h5>
    <li><b>Industrial encroachment:</b> Homes near data centers can lose value because of noise, traffic, and aesthetics
      appeal.</li>
    <li><b>Reduced livability:</b></li> Constant humming, increased truck traffic, and land degradation can make
    neighborhoods less attractive. Livability conditions can decline, including health concerns such as headaches,
    stress, and sleep disruption.
    <li><b>Market perception:</b></li> Potential buyers may avoid regions near large data centers, because of anxiety of
    future developments or environmental risks of damage.

    <h4>Tax incentives vs. community costs:</h4>
    Governments lure data centers for revenue, but residents ultimately pay the environmental and property Value
    outcomes.


    <h5>What Happens to Water Resources</h5>
    <li><b>Local strain:</b></li>Municipal water systems supplies are transported to cooling operations.
    <li><b>Climate vulnerability:</b></li> Water shortages can be accelerated in prone-drought regions and this results
    in concern of resource allocation.
    <li><b>Regulatory pressure:</b></li> Communities and investors are examining if these hubs shuld be built near
    water-resource environments.

    <h5>Mitigation strategies</h5>
    Data centers are exploring alternatives for water recycling, cooling methods, and efficiency improvements to reduce
    water shortages.
    In short: AI hubs (data centers) are often described as “resource vampires” because they consume enormous amounts of
    land, power, and water. They can lower housing values, intensify drought conditions, and place heavy burdens on
    local water systems.
